# Background Information

Column {data-width=350}
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
#### **What is this dashboard?**
This is my final project for EDLD 652 Data Visualization at the University of Oregon as part of a [Data Science Specialization](https://education.uoregon.edu/epol/specialization-educational-data-science). For this project, I created visualizations depicting data focused on food choices and eating habits.

#### **Where are these data from?**
These data came from the [Vegans and vegetarians have higher othorexic traits than omnivores and choose food for reasons including ethics and weight control](https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/Untitled_Item/21006490), which is an open-source, de-identified data set available for download. 

#### **Who made this dashboard?**
I did, Leah Peterson! I also had emotional support from my dog. Making data visualizations in RStudio is painful sometimes, so she really helped keeping morale up.

Column {data-width=10}

Column {.tabset data-width=650}
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

#### **My Variables**

##### *Food Choice Questionnaire (FCQ)*
This measure is evaluating the at the individual level what factors one uses to make food choices. Steptoe et al. (1995) developed the 36 item measure to include nine factors: health, mood, convenience, sensory appeal, natural content, price, weight control, familiarity, and ethical concerns. This measure allows us to systematically compare the importance of health related and non-health related food choice factors. 

##### *Eating Disorder (ED) History*
Eating disorders, such as anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa, have been linked to differences in diet types (Bardone-Cone et al., 2012) and individual food choices (Barthels et al., 2020). 
One eating disorder, orthorexia nervosa (ON), has recently been getting an increase of attention in the research community. [Orthorexia nervosa](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6370446/) is an unhealthy obsession with healthy eating. Those who are diagnosed with ON are obsessed with healthy eating in such a way that disrupts their daily life and involves restrictive actions regarding food.

##### *Highest Level of Education*
Higher educational attainment has been correlated with a healthier diet (Azizi Fard et al., 2021). In these data, there are four levels of education collected:

1. Did not graduate high school

2. Graduated high school

3. Associates degree or equivalent

4. Bachelors degree or higher

##### *Types of Dietary Practices* 
Dietary practices are defined by a participant’s preference in food consumption or behaviors of dietary habits. This sample has the following diets:

1. Pescatarian: Individuals who do not eat meat, but do eat seafood.

2. Omnivore: Individuals who eat meat, seafood, and plant-based foods.

3. Vegetarian: Individuals who do not eat meat.

4. Vegan: Individuals who do not eat meat or any animal derived food, such as eggs or dairy.

In the following visualizations, vegan and vegetarian dietary practices will be combined and omnivore diets will be split into three categories: plant-heavy omnivore, moderate omnivore (consumes an equal amount of plant based food and animal based foods), and animal-heavy omnivore.

> My final visualization is interactive, which is a change between version 3 and this final plot.

### Version 1

  scale_alpha_identity() +
  ylim(0,20) +
  guides(size = "none") 
```

> This is the first verison of this visualization. This graph is trying to depict how people with and without past eating disorders chose food based on the nine food choice motives on the x-axis. The circle size in the first graph shows the FCQ score of each group for each motive, which is also the y-axis. The graph title is going off the page, so that was one issue I knew I had to fix. 

### Version 2

                    alpha = ifelse(PastEDYesNo == "No", 0.2, 1))) +

  scale_size_continuous(range = c(2, 10)) +
  labs(title = "Health Factors Drive Food Choices for People With 
and Without an Eating Disorder History",
       x = "Food Choice Motives",
       y = "FCQ Score",

        legend.position = "top",
        plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5)) +
  scale_color_manual(values = c("No" = "plum", "Yes" = "darkred")) +
  scale_x_discrete(labels = name_mapping) +
  scale_alpha_identity() +
  ylim(0,20) +
  guides(size = "none") 
```

> In version two of the graph, I used peer feedback to have the circles have a dodge position so that they're easier to see. Also, the color of the circles changed so that there was a lighter and darker color. I think this change helped if there was someone who was colorblind looking at the graph, they'd be able to understand it the same. Another addition is the caption explaining what the circle size means. From feedback, I came to the conclusion that even though I like the circles, I needed to change the meaning of circle size, because it is repetitive for it to be the same measurement as the y-axis.

### Version 3
```{r}
library(ggplot2)

ggplot(combined_ED, aes(x = Factor, y = Correlations, size = Mean, color = PastEDYesNo, label = round(Mean, 1))) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.7) + 
  geom_text(vjust = -2, size = 3) +
  labs(title = "Previous Eating Disorder Diagnoses Linked to Greater Orthorexic
       Tendencies Despite Similar Importance Placed on Food Choice Motives",
       x = "Food Choice Motives",
       y = "Strength of Correlation with Orthorexic Tendencies",
       color = "Past ED Diagnosis",
       caption = "Eating Disorder (ED) 
Larger circles represent greater importance of food motive") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1),
        legend.position = "top",
        plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5, size = 12)) +
  scale_color_manual(values = c("No" = "plum", "Yes" = "darkred")) +
  scale_x_discrete(labels = name_mapping) +
  scale_alpha_identity() +
  guides(size = "none") +
  ylim(-.25, .5)

```

> In the third version of the graph, I updated the y-axis to be the correlation between the factor and the orthorexia tendency of the two groups. That way the circle size representing the factor importance was not repetitive. I have a static caption to show the actual correlation value above the circle, but I thought the visualization was too cluttered.

> In the final version of this visualization I changed the orientation to be horizontal and instead of sepearate bars, to have one bar for each level of eduaction because the sum to 100%. To increase the readability of the graph, I moved the education levels from the x-axis to the y-axis so they would not be overlapping. 
I added in a 50% line to show where the vegan/vegetarian group and omnivore group would meet if there was an equal representation from both groups. Additionally, I added captions in the graph to show the exact percentage totals of the groups. I got feeback that removing "Diet type" from the legend would not change a readers understanding of the graph so I did remove that phrase.

```

> This is my first attempt of the visualization that is depicting the different diet types by highest education level completed. The x-axis showing the different education levels is practicly unreadable. 
I chose a very light color palette that you would still be able to read the differences if the graph were in black in white, making it color-blind friendly. 
I also left the y-axis label blank because the percentages on the y-axis make it clear they’re graphing the precent. I tried to have a more active title for this graph. I thought since there was such a clear difference in results for the did not graduate high school group, it was easier to make an active title.

```

> In version 1, there were 6 groups for different vegan and vegetarian diets. In this final version, I combined them into one diet type, as it represents only 10% of the sample. 
Additionally, I got rid of the color and changed the bars to lollipops. Each end of the lollipop has a graphic I created the represents the differnt diet type. Additionally, I moved the diet types to the y-axis instead of having the color legend at the bottom. I think this makes the graph cleaner and easier for anyone to read! 
Lastly, I added the percentages for each diet type so the reader had the exact number, which would be hard to get from the x-axis. I did remove the x-axis label because it seemed redundant with the title.

> I originally wanted to show the different countries and their diet types; however, the samples for the other countries are too small, for example Canada had on person and then the UK only had 2 of the diet types. It just wasn’t a very interesting graph at that point. So instead, I focused in on just the United States. 
I had the colors be different diet types and then those colors are in the legend. This proved hard to read with so many diet types, I knew I wanted to simplify it.

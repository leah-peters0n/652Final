The website (https://leah-peters0n.github.io/652Final/#background-information) has the three final visualizations and their previous versions. Also, there is the source code in upper right corner.
In this github page, you access everything to recreate the online dashboard. The code I used is in the index.Rmd file. The data is saved in the data folder. All graphics used are in the grpahics folder. The docs folder is used to deploy the website.
